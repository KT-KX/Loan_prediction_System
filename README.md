# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan approval outcomes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop an efficient and inclusive credit risk assessment model by leveraging diverse financial data such as deposit balances, outstanding loans, and transactional history across banks and e-wallets.

## Problem Statement
Loan approval processes are often inefficient and biased, limiting access to credit for certain segments of the population. By using a data-driven approach, this project aims to improve the accuracy and fairness of credit risk assessments, facilitating more inclusive loan approvals.

## Dataset
We are currently using a placeholder dataset from Kaggle's credit-risk category until the actual dataset is available. The dataset includes features such as:
- Borrower demographics
- Financial transaction history
- Loan repayment behavior
- Deposit balances

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzing distributions and relationships among variables
   - Identifying patterns and trends in the data

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features to enhance predictive power
   - Selecting important features using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance ranking

4. **Model Development**
   - Implementing machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms (e.g., CatBoost).
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model performance.

6. **Deployment**
   - Developing a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to input data and obtain predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, CatBoost
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Version Control: Git

## Results
The model is evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict loan approval while minimizing false negatives (i.e., eligible borrowers incorrectly rejected) and false positives (i.e., risky borrowers incorrectly approved).

## Future Work
- Integrate the actual dataset for enhanced model training.
- Incorporate additional data sources, such as alternative credit scores.
- Implement explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure model transparency and fairness.
- Deploy the model as a web-based application.
